Three bash scripts handle all of the computation performed.

process_midi.sh
-- Calls a number of other scripts to process midi files into audio files and to form the experts used in Exp4.

plot_expert_weights.sh
-- Plots the evolution of the weights of the experts as a fucntion of round number for the three sessions of Exp4 that I logged.

calculate_the_probability_of_a_random_ranking_yielding_a_longer_LIS.sh
-- Calculates the empirical probablities that a random ranking of composers paired with my independent ranking of composers would yield a longer increasing subsequence of composers than the rankings generated by the three sessions of Exp4 that I logged would.

Additionally, the code for the web application is located in the "web_application" directory.
